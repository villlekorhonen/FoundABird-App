# FoundABird-App
This is the final project of a mobile programming course. I started to think about what a normal person who enjoys the outdoors and is interested in observing birds might need. I came up with an idea that the app should include the ability to save birds you see in to a list. If you don't recognize a particular bird, you can check a picture or information from the database. Then I thought that maybe a map would be cool, so you can check the actual location of your sightings.

This is frontpage, where you can select your actions. Save sighting if you want to save bird, My Birds is list screen, where is a list of your saved birds. All birds of Finland, where you can find birds in Finland. Weather shows actual weather in you current location and you can also type location and check the waether. Map will show your current location.
